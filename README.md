# GeeChats
A web based texting application I made for practice. <br>
Used Socket.IO for chatting implementation.

### Note
1. Do not use emojis. The app will not work.
2. In general, the application is buggy. I did not spend too much time debugging. Made this app just to explore WebSockets.

### Usage
1. Sign up/Login
2. Go to "Add Friends". Type friend username and click Add.
3. You can now chat!
